Welcome to Begriff Bot!
I’m here to help you learn and explore new words in a foreign language.

Here’s what you can do:

📝 Add words to your study list — Just send a list of words (one per line), and I’ll explain them automatically.
🗣️ Check a sentence — Send a sentence (30+ characters) to get feedback on grammar and word choice.
🔤 Translate or clarify —
    Start your message with !! to translate from your native language to the one you're studying.
    Use ?? to ask for clarification on something confusing.

💬 React to my replies:
    🤔 for help with your options
    🙏 to get more details or examples
    👎 if you didn’t like the answer — I’ll try again

🌐 Share a URL — Paste a link to get a summary in your target language, using words you’ve been learning.

📜 /list — View your saved words and their details
📚 /study — Begin a study session with your words
📚 /check — Another way to check a sentence for grammar
🌍 /language — Change the language you're learning
🚀 /start — Launch the tutorial and setup
❓ /help — See this command guide anytime

    # how to make chains of signals reusable:
    # - here we set some mark: "this is onboarding"
    # - all the chains of signals starting from the signal with this mark
    # should carry it
    # - bus.on can check if there's a mark and decide if the chain should go
    # I.e. @bus.on(NativeLanguageSaved, conditions={'onboarding': True})
    # launches a slot only if there is onboarding mark ON THE SIGNAL.
    # This is not a global flag, hence it doesn't introduce side effects.
    # How will this work?
    # - Context object should carry `signal` property, which stores the current
    # signal if the request started from it
    #   - what if there are several signals? Should they be added to the list?
    #   - what if it's a study session? The signals list will be endless
    #   - signals are lightweight, even a thousand of them is not that much,
    #     but still it poses a vulnerability
    # - Bus dispatcher code looks at the signal and checks conditions
    #   - at which signal should it look?
    # Interface can be modelled well with a directed graph.
    # - Signals are arrows, but not exactly arrows
    # - Should we store all the path along the graph?
    # - Should we have a state for each walk along the graph? Not global.
    # Where such walk starts?
    # - from any non-signal event: command, callback, message
    # - maybe the walk should have a timeout
    # - if another walk starts, should the previous one end? not necessarily
    # - now messaes and their context is used to track walks

So now you know what those words mean — and hopefully you understand the paragraph better. But will you still remember them in a week or two, or when you see them again in another text?

To strengthen your memory, spend a few minutes each day reviewing the words you’ve looked up. Here's how it works:

☝️ I’ll show you a word, and you try to recall its meaning.

✌️ If you remember it, press "ANSWER" to check. Then rate your recall — I’ll schedule your next review accordingly.

🖐 If you can’t recall it, press "ANSWER" anyway, read the explanation, and try to memorize it again.

There’s solid science behind how this works — the better you remember a word, the less often you’ll see it. But if you're starting to forget it, I’ll make sure it comes up again.

You can start a study session anytime with the /study command. Practice regularly, and progress will follow in no time.

Other useful commands to try:

• `!!` — translates a phrase from {native_flag} to {studied_flag}.

• `??` — clarifies tricky parts in {studied_flag}.

• Send me a text longer than 30 characters — I’ll check it for mistakes.

• Send me the URL of an article — I’ll summarize it for you, highlighting words you’re learning (try it on Wikipedia!).

 • Didn’t like my explanation? React with 👎 and I’ll redo it.

• Need a usage example? React with 🙏 and I’ll give you one.

You can open the cheatsheet anytime with the /help command.
