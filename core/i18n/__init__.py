# The concept is this:
#
# - a delayed string class gets and stores English strings
# - there is a function which collects all the declared entities of this class and saves them in a `.pot` file;
# - There is a function to resolve the delayed string, which takes it and the locale and returns the string in a given language.
# - Language files are stored in `data/locale/` folder in gettext `.po` format.
# - The resolving function implements lazy-loading of language files: a language file is loaded when the user with this language makes a request.
# - There is support for translating on demand: if a user with a new language appears, the background translation is started via some external api (e.g. Google Translate or an OpenAI-compatible LLM) and, when finished, is saved into a new language file.
# - If a delayed string is not resolved till the time of usage, it defaults to its English value.
# - Delayed strings behave like regulr strings as much as possible, e.g. they're serializable.
# - This mechanics tries to be compliant with gettext logic and file format, but allows fine control of strings resolution and simplifies generating new translations.
# - If an application is started without any `.po` files, it generates them on the fly not bothering the user, and generates translation files on demand, allowing to improve the translation later.
#
# Example workflow:
# 1.  *Developer*: Adds `NEW_FEATURE_PROMPT = TranslatableString("Please enable the new feature.")` to `app/features/new.py`.
# 2.  *Developer*: Runs `python scripts/collect_strings.py`. The `messages.pot` file is updated with the new string.
# 3.  *User A (locale: `es`)*: Interacts with the bot. The feature prompt needs to be displayed.
# 4.  *System*: `ctx.resolve(NEW_FEATURE_PROMPT)` is called.
# 5.  *System*: `Context` checks for `data/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo`. It doesn't exist.
# 6.  *System*: A background task is launched to translate all strings in `messages.pot` to Spanish and create `messages.po`/`.mo`.
# 7.  *System*: For the current request, `resolve` falls back and returns the English string: "Please enable the new feature.".
# 8.  *User B (locale: `es`)*: Later makes a request that also requires the same prompt.
# 9.  *System*: By now, the background task has finished, and `messages.mo` exists.
# 10. *System*: `Context` lazy-loads `data/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo` into its cache.
# 11. *System*: `resolve` now looks up the string and returns the Spanish version: "Por favor, active la nueva funciÃ³n.".
